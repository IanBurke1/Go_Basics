# Go

### How to run a Go file
```bash
$ go run 01_helloWorld.go
```

### How to make an executable Go file
**Note:** run this command inside the source package directory e.g. github.com/user/01_helloWorld.go
 ```bash
 $ go install
 ```
 The 01_helloWorld.exe file should be in the bin folder. Open a terminal inside that folder and run:
  ```bash
 $ 01_helloWorld
 ```
